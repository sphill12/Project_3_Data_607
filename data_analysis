# OTHER THOUGHTS...
# Relationships between open and close prices

# Distribution of the closing stock price 

# High/Low difference shows how volatile a stock was day to day 

# Relationship between high and low differences and volume

# Trends in difference between opening and closing

# Maybe look at average daily volume (number of shares traded in a given period)
